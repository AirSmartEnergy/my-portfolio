        <h2 align = center;> 1. About me  </h2> <img src=""
            <p> Hello! My name is Saad and I enjoy creating things that live on the internet.
                  My interest in Embedded Systems and Front End Development started back 
                    in 2016 when I decited to make a home automation system project in my bacholars degree,
                    
                    - Turns out I have made microcontrollers as my pets.</p>
                    <br>

<p>  Fast-forward to today, and I've had the privilege of working in many start-ups and companies.
     My main focus these days is building an Energy Monitoring System for Industrial Applications at <a href="https://www.au.edu.pk">Embedded Systems Lab -AU</a> 
     .Also, I am working with multiple clients as a freelancer. </p>
<p> Here are some technologies I have worked on : </p>
<ul>
<li>Microcontroller Programming (AVR,Espressif,STM32)</li>
<li>FreeRTOS</li>
<li>Alitum, Eagle and Proteus</li>
<li>JavaScript</li>
<li>React</li>
<li>DS SOLIDWORKS</li>
<li>DS CATIA V5</li>
</ul>
